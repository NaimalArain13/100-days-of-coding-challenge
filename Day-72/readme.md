#Generics  
In TypeScript are a feature that allows you to write reusable code by passing a type as a parameter to another type, whether it's a class, interface, or function. This means that you don't always have to specify the type explicitly when writing code, as you can use Generics to work flexibly with various types without resorting to using ": any."

The main advantages of using Generics include:

Code Reusability: You can use the same code with different types without rewriting it.
Enhanced Safety: Generics help detect potential errors at compile time rather than runtime.
Dealing with Multiple Types: Generics allow you to work with a variety of types without specifying a particular type.
Generics can be used in TypeScript to create:

Generic Classes.
Generic Functions.
Generic Interfaces.
Generic Methods.
