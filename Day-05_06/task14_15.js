// Question 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

// Question 15: Changing Guest List: One of your guests can't make it to the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations with a replacement guest.
