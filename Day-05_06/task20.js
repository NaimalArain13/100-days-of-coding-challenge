// Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// Explain & TIP: Arrays are perfect for keeping a collection of similar items. Choose a theme you like and list several examples.
var cities = ["Karachi", "Hyderabad", "Lahore", "Islamabad", "Quetta"];
console.log("I would love to visit these citites ".concat(cities));
// Question 21: Think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.
// Explain & TIP: Objects in TypeScript can store various related data about a single entity. Think of an object as a container for characteristics of something, like a book or a car.
var book = {
    title: "My Religion", author: "Anonymous", publishedYear: 2001
};
console.log("".concat(book.title, " written by ").concat(book.author, " in year ").concat(book.publishedYear));
