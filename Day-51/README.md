Why you should completely read it?
Many students ask that how to build logic in programming, how to understand the things, etc. so this article is the answer of most of your questions in simple words.

"Getting Insights From This Reading"

01- "PRACTICE YOUR THEORETICAL CONCEPTS": We must practice what we have learnt theoretically because when we read something we thought that we get the concept prefectly but when we try it after sometime nothing is clear to us because we didn't practice the concpet practically at reading time

02- "CONSISTENCY": Consistency is the key to success. Consistency is important in every aspect of learning and in coding if we take a gap we will forget the concept. 

03- "DON'T DEEP DIVE IN THE BEGINNING": At the starting of learning programming, don't deep dive in a single concept because this will end up with nothing but confusion.

04- "READING ERRORS": Start trying to read the error messages because most of the solution to fix the error are in the error message.

05- "SOLVING MCQs": As soon as you learn a concept, start solving MCQs like coding snippets and conceptual.

06- "HAND WRITTEN CODING": This is another good approach to master any concept and it will help you most of the time.

07- "READING OTHERS' CODE": When you read other people's code, you will get the solution of what you find tough.

08- "POLISH YOUR PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS": In coding the more you will think on any problem, the less response time your brain will take beacuse when you take time while solving a problem it will boost your problem-solving skills.

09- "MAKE CHUNKS TO LEARN CONCEPT": It is great move to make small pieces of your work to fully understand the concept.

10- "FIND GOOD MENTOR": Having a good mentor is the blessing for your from ALLAH. A mentor helps your in every bit of life.
